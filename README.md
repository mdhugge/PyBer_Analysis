# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the PyBer Analysis
PyBer is a python based ride-sharing company. An analysis was performed on the ride-sharing data to determine the total weekly fares for each city type. A line graph was created to showcase the relationship between fare and the week of the rideshare for each city type (i.e. urban, suburban and rural).

## Results

![Summary](https://github.com/mdhugge/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Summary.png)

The total number of rides is the greatest in urban cities and lowest in rural cities. The number of rides in urban cities is 1000 and 1500 more than in suburban and rural cities, respectively. Similarly, there is a greater number of drivers in urban cities than in suburban and rural cities. Urban cities have 1915 and 2327 more drivers than suburban and rural cities, respectively. The total fare is also the highest in urban cities, which is $20,498.05 an $35,526.45 more than suburban and rural cities, respectively. 

Since, the total rides, total drivers and total fares is the greatest in urban cities the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is the lowest in urban cities as expected. The average fare per ride is about $6 and $10 more in suburban and rural cities, respectively in comparison to urban cities. The average fare per driver is about $6 and $10 more in suburban and rural cities, respectively in comparison to urban cities.

From January to April the total fares in urban cities is greater than in rural and suburban cities with rural cities having the lowest total fare. As indicated by the yellow line the total fare for urban cities falls between $1600 to $ 2500 from January to April. The red line shows that the total fare for suburban cities falls between $700 to $ 1500 from January to April. Lastly, the blue line shows the total fare for rural cities falls between $50 to $550 from January to April. All three city types had a spike in the total fares towards the end of February. Rural cities also had another spike in total fares at the beginning of April. All three city types had the lowest total fare at the beginning of January.


## Summary
Based on the disparities between the city types 3 recommendations that PyBer could implement are:

- Decrease the average fare per ride in rural cities as it is much higher than in the urban and suburban cities. This could create an affordability issue for residents of rural cities and may explain why there are a fewer number of rideshares in the rural cities.

- Increase the number of drivers in rural cities as a lack of drivers would limit access to the rideshare services. 

- Increase marketing efforts in rural cities to promote the ridesharing service as rural cities have the fewest number of rides. If residents do not know about the service they will not access it.
