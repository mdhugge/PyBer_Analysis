# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the PyBer Analysis
PyBer is a python based ride-sharing company. An analysis was performed on the ride-sharing data to determine the total weekly fares for each city type. A line graph was created to showcase the relationship between fare and the week of the rideshare for each city type (i.e. urban, suburban and rural).

## Results

The total number of rides is the greatest in urban cities and lowest in rural cities. The number of rides in urban cities is 1000 and 1500 more than in suburban and rural cities, respectively. Similarly, there is a greater number of drivers in urban cities than in suburban and rural cities. Urban cities have 1915 and 2327 more drivers than suburban and rural cities, respectively. The total fare is also the highest in urban cities, which is $20,498.05 an $35,526.45 more than suburban and rural cities, respectively. 

Since, the total rides, total drivers and total fares is the greatest in urban cities the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is the lowest in urban cities as expected. The average fare per ride is about $6 and $10 more in suburban and rural cities, respectively in comparison to urban cities. The average fare per driver is about $6 and $10 more in suburban and rural cities, respectively in comparison to urban cities.

In every month from January to April the total fares in urban cities is greater than in rural and suburban cities with rural cities having the lowest total fare. All three city types had a spike in the total fares towards the end of February. Rural cities also had another spike in total fares at the beginning of April. All three city types had the lowest total fare at the beginning of January.


## Summary
Based on the disparities between the city types PyBer could consider decreasing the average fare per ride in rural cities as it is much higher than in the urban and suburban cities. This creates an affordability issue for resident of rural cities which may explain why there are a fewer number of rideshares in the rural cities. PyBer could also increase marketing of the rideshare service in rural cities as there are fewer rideshares and drivers in rural cities in comparison to urban and suburban areas. The lack of drivers in the rural cities impedes access to the service in rural cities.
